# Flag guessing

Using JS, CSS, HTML and APIs I have created a flag guessing game.

Two APIs were necessary for this application. First was used to get "ISO Alpha-2" code of a country and then that code would be used to load a corresponding
flag.

On game start or on loading next question, the app would generate 4 random numbers. One of the numbers would be selected as the correct answer.
Using those numbers, country names are being loaded from country list API. The flag of the selected correct answer is being loaded on the screen.
